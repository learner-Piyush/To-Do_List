# To-Do_List
This is my first fully functional project which is a To Do List.
This Project contains it's structure which is written in HTML and it's design which is written in CSS along with it's functionality which is written in JS.

In this project you can add your tasks by just typing your task and click on the add button.
If you click on the li tag, there will be a line which will cross through it's center.
And if you click the delete button, the whole li tag will remove.

Logic is simple if you open and look at the JS file.

And yeah I have added icons for buttons.

Let me know if you like the design and experience as well
